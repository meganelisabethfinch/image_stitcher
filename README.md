# Image Stitcher
A simple panorama or image stitcher. 

The image stitcher uses SIFT to detect keypoints in a pair of images, then matches each keypoint descriptor in one image to its two nearest neighbours in the other, and applies the ratio test described in [1] to filter for good matches. A match is considered 'good' if the distances of the two nearest neighbours differ by less than a ratio; otherwise, the match is likely to be erroneous and is discarded.

The positions of the matched keypoints are used to compute a homography that transforms the right-hand image into the correct plane. The left image is then overlaid to create the panorama. 

## üñºÔ∏è Example
Input:

<p float="left">
<img src="https://github.com/meganelisabethfinch/image-stitcher/blob/main/images/NewnLeft.jpeg" alt="Peile Building, Newnham College (left side)" width="49%" />
<img src="https://github.com/meganelisabethfinch/image-stitcher/blob/main/images/NewnRight.jpeg" alt="Peile Building, Newnham College (right side)" width="49%"  /> 
</p>

Output:

<p float="left">
<img src="https://github.com/meganelisabethfinch/image-stitcher/blob/main/images/NewnOutColour.jpeg" alt="A stitched image of Peile Building, Newnham College" width=98%" />
